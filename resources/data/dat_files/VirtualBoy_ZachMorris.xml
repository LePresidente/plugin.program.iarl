		<emu_comment>No Intro Virtual Boy List by Zach Morris.  This is the full unfiltered list from the archive.[CR]The Virtual Boy was a table-top video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was the first video game console that was supposed to be capable of displaying "true 3D graphics" out of the box, in a form of virtual reality. Whereas most video games use monocular cues to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, The Virtual Boy creates an illusion of depth through the effect known as parallax. In a manner similar to using a head-mounted display, the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America at a price of around US$180. It then became a commercial failure and it was not released in PAL markets. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Nintendo discontinued it the following year.[CR]Developer: Nintendo[CR]Manufacturer: Nintendo[CR]CPU: NEC V810[CR]Memory: 128 KB dual-port VRAM[CR]Sound: 16-bit Stereo[CR]Display: 84 x 224 pixel resolution (produced by scanning a 1 Ã— 224 LED array)[CR]Media: Cartridge[CR]Max Controllers: 1</emu_comment>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]3D Tetris was the last official game released for the Virtual Boy on March 22nd 1996. The game was developed by T&amp;E Soft and was exclusive to the United States after the Japanese release, which was scheduled for a February 1996 release, was cancelled due to a lack of interest in the Virtual Boy system.3D Tetris requires the player to completely fill a 3d well with shapes that can be moved in a 2D plane and rotated on a 3D plane using the left and right gamepads respectively. Every time a piece of a shape extends beyond the well, that piece is destroyed along with bottom most level of the well. The game is lost when all levels of the well are destroyed.</plot>

				<title_clean>Bound High</title_clean>
				<plot>Originally developed by Japan System Supply, Nintendo liked the game idea of Bound High! and took over the project later. The game was, besides Dragon Hopper, going to be one of the games, which should have saved the system with a relaunch, but it was delayed again and again until it was cancelled because of the lack of success of the Virtual Boy. At this time, the game already was completely finished.[CR]In Bound High!, Chalvo, the bouncing robot, travels through space In full 3d-D motion in pursuit of alien invaders that threaten the peaceful inhabitants of Earth. Angling from above, players control rolled up Chalvo, who must destroy all enemies on the playfield by landing on them and throwing them down from the playfield. Falling off the playfield himself, Chalvo will loose a life.[CR]The playfield is in space, or high above the earth, and is made of many little squares, which are composed differently from level to level, once big plain areas, once many small, scattered blocks. Bouncing over the platforms can be quite incalculable and dangerous, while some are solid, other ones vanish after one hit or reveal puzzles, items or other objects and besides a lot of different enemies, Chalvo also has to carefully avoid winds, the deep crevices, sharp spikes and highly charged electric "shockers" that cause his demise. Adding to the difficulty is the rebound angle when you hit a moving enemy - you don't necessarily bounce straight up in the air.[CR]Sometimes blocks lead to an "Another Stage", some kind of mirrored parallel universe with inverted colors and without the dangerous winds.</plot>

				<title_clean>Innsmouth no Yakata</title_clean>
				<plot>Insmouse No Yakata is a video game based on a low-budget Japanese horror film of the same name which has gained a cult following in Japan, which is itself based loosely on H.P. Lovecraft's story "The Shadow Over Innsmouth".  It has the distinction of being not only the only first-person shooter but also the only survival-horror game  in the Virtual Boy's small library.The player will traverse no more than 13 of 45 possible levels per playthrough.  Each level has several enemy creatures, which are killed using a gun from the first-person perspective.  Since ammunition is scarce and the player cannot slip past enemy creatures without killing them, there is a strong survival horror aspect to the gameplay motivating the player to find alternate routes rather than resorting to combat.  Each level is completed by finding a key, which allows the player to progress to the next level or the ending, of which there are four.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Blimps are a villain's vehicle of choice. Mario is attempting to clear  the bad guys  out of the "Clash Tower"  after they take over in their big  evil-looking blimp. He'll have to clear the place out on his own, one floor at a time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mario throwing objects indoors. For shame.Mario Clash is a remake of the Mario Bros. arcade game for the Virtual Boy. It features many of the same  enemies as the  original game,  plus a few new additions like Paragoombas  and Boo Buddies. Since the game attempts to show off the 3-D capabilities of the Virtual Boy, Mario is able and often required to attack enemies by tossing Koopa shells at them from opposing sides of the playing field. To make sure this is possible, there are two Koopas on screen at all times. Each stage can only be completed when Mario defeats every single enemy on screen. There is a mushroom counter on the upper-right hand corner of the playing field. It counts down once for every non-Koopa that Mario defeats. If he destroys all of them, he enters "Fever Time," where a hit from any direction with a Koopa shell will defeat any enemy and scoring is doubled.Mini-GameEvery few stages there is an interlude for a mini-game. Mario must collect as many coins as possible to earn extra lives.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mario's Tennis</title_clean>
				<plot>Mario's Tennis was released on August 14th, 1995 and was the North American pack-in game that came along with the Virtual Boy game system when you bought it. Making it the first game released for the system.Because of the game being a pack-in title, it did not come in a normal Virtual Boy box. Instead the Virtual Boy Mario Tennis cartridge just came with the system loose, along with an instruction manual and black "protector" case that covers the part of the cart that slides into the system. In Japan you could buy the game separately with it's own box since the game wasn't a pack-in game in Japan.Mario's Tennis uses the 3D effects of the Virtual Boy by having the player hit the Tennis Ball with their racket to the other side of the court. The ball thusly looks like it is heading towards you or away from you in a simulated 3D effect. The game contains 7 characters from the Mario universe that you can play as: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Toad, Princess Toadstool/Peach, Donkey Kong Jr., and Koopa Troopa.A two-player mode is technically available in the game, but the Virtual Boy Link Cable that you would use to link two Virtual Boy game systems together to play two-player was never released. Thus it is impossible to play two-player Mario's Tennis.Mario's Tennis was a prelude to Nintendo and developer Camelot's series of Mario Sports games that started with Mario Golf, released for the Nintendo 64 in 1999. And was followed up with Mario Tennis for N64 in 2000. Obviously, Mario Tennis wouldn't have existed without the groundwork that Nintendo first-party Mario's Tennis developer R&amp;D1 had laid when they developed Mario's Tennis for the Virtual Boy in 1995.Although Mario Sports games had existed since the NES era with Nintendo's own Tennis and Golf games on NES (complete with Mario as the referee); the groundwork for the modern version of Mario Sports games was given it's birth with the Virtual Boy's Mario's Tennis. It was the first Nintendo Mario Sports game that included the 8 playable Mario universe characters. A tradition that was brought over from the SNES classic and mega-hit kart-racing game, Super Mario Kart. Which had the same 8 playable characters as that game's cast.Mario's Tennis is arguably the most popular, well known and easily found Virtual Boy game, due to the nature of the game being the pack-in title for the system in North America.This generally means that anyone who bought a Virtual Boy game system new at stores at the time the system was being sold, most likely owned a copy of Mario's Tennis which came with the system. Thus it is very easy to find a copy of Mario's Tennis to kick-start your Virtual Boy collection. Although it is rarer to have a "complete" copy of Mario's Tennis with a box, since they were only sold "complete" in Japan and not North America.[CR]Intro (From instruction manual)[CR]On the CourtThere has never been a tennis game like Mario's Tennis. Mario, Yoshi and the whole cast of your favorite characters move freely around a completely three-dimensional tennis court. If you move to the net, and your opponent lobs, the ball seems to actually fly over your head. There has never been a game that was able to realistically create the feeling of depth on the court. You'll find yourself trying to turn around and check the line when your opponent slams a passing shot down the line. It's time to prove that you can serve, volley and rally with the best of them![CR]CAST OF CHARACTERS[CR]MarioHe's an average player whose court speed and leg strength are solid. His racquet contact area is average, and he relies on his skillful groundstrokes, though he will approach the net occasionally.LuigiHis skill level and court strategy are similar to Mario's. He has better court coverage, though, due to being faster than Mario.Princess Toadstool (Peach)The Princess is slow, but her racquet contact area is large. She doesn't' like to approach the net, preferring to instead rally from the baseline.YoshiHe is the fastest of all the players, but his racquet contact area is small. He plays an aggressive type of game by rushing the net at every opportunity.ToadToad is quite quick on the court, but his racquet contact area is not very large. Like Yoshi, he tries to approach the net often. Though he is no strong, he has great court coverage because he can lunge at tough balls.KoopaBeing a turtle, basically, his court speed suffers. he has a large racquet contact area though. He likes to rally from the baseline, and he also can lunge at tough shots like Toad.Donkey Kong Jr.He is slower than all the other players, and also has a smaller racquet contact area. He is however, understandably the most powerful of all the players. His strong groundstorkes allow him to win many points from the baseline.* The racquet contact area only changes when playing on Hard difficulty level. The racquet contact area affects the players ability to return balls that are far away or too close to the player. On any level faster players are faster and powerful players hit strong shots.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]Left Control Pad (D-Pad on Left Side) - Move the player, Control Shot Adjustment, Move through selections.A Button - Hit the Ball (Solid Shot), Toss the Ball, Register a selection, Move to next point.B Button - Hit the Ball (Soft Shot, Lob), Toss the Ball.Select Button - Press when game is Paused to access the adjustment screen.Start Button - Pause the game, advance to the next screen.* Right Control Pad, R Button and L Button not used.Moving the PlayerUse the Left Control Pad and your player moves forward, back, left and right.Serving1.

If the ball is above your head, you will automatically do an overhead smash. When near the net, you automatically volley. Press the B Button to Lob.Using the Left Control PadThe Left Control Pad is used to control the placement of your shots on the court. If you press the Left Control Pad at the same time that you hti the ball, you can direct the shot as follows:* UP on the Left Control Pad = Long Backcourt Shot* DOWN on the Left Control Pad = Short Frontcourt Shot* LEFT or RIGHT on the Left Control Pad = Shot Toward SidelineSpeed Up Between PointsPress the A Button between points to speed up the action. Your character will run to the service line, and point information will not be displayed on screen as long.PausePress the Start Button at any time to Pause game play. While the game is paused, you can adjust the Virtual Boy IPD and focus. If you want to make adjustments, press the Select Button (while paused) to access the IPD and focus screen. After making adjustments, Press Start to return to the pause screen. Press start again to go back to game play. Note: You cannot access the Auto Pause On/Off selection by pausing the game.ResetIf you press Start, Select, the A, B, L and R Buttons simultaneously, the game will reset (this is called a "Soft Reset")Low Battery IndicatorWhen battery power is low, you will see a flashing battery indicator in the corner of the screen. Please change the batteries as soon as possible after the indicator appears.[CR]How to Play[CR]Title ScreenThere are two modes of play in Mario's Tennis. At the Title Screen, you can select between Singles or Doubles with the Left Control Pad, then register your selection with the A Button.Singles PlaySelect either "1P vs COM" (1 player versus the computer AI) or "Tournament" with the Left Control Pad. Next, select the difficulty level and length of the match. Use the Left Control Pad to select your player character, and press the A button to register your selection. Then, select your opponent with the Left Control Pad and press the A button.Doubles PlayMake the selections as indicated for Singles play. Next select your player character, your partner and your two opponents.TournamentWhen playing Tournament, you'll see the bracket screen that shows the player matchups and your opponent is randomly selected. During the tournament, the outcome of matches other than your own is decided by the computer. Enter the tournament by pressing the A Button.Be sure to select the difficulty level and the length of the match before selecting the player characters. If you press Start before selecting player characters, Mario plays Donkey Kong Jr. in the Singles mode. In the Doubles mode, the teams are set as Mario &amp; Yoshi vs Donkey Kong Jr. &amp; Toad if you don't select the players.Court ScreenCourt - Notice that the net is decorated with hearts. The court is used for both Singles and Doubles mode.Lakitu - Lakitu is the Chair Umpire (High and above the court) and score keeper for all of the matches. There is no complaining about line calls allowed with this judge! Mario fans will remember Lakitu as the Koopa Troopa with glasses floating in a cloud who drops Spiney enemies on our heroes.Your Player Character - Your player always appears at the bottom of the screen. Watch the facial expressions of the different characters!Results ScreenExcept for Tournament matches, the Results Screen shown below is displayed at the end of every match. This screen gives you the chance to see how well you played in the match by displaying various statistics. Press the A Button to return to the title screen.Total Points - Total of points won.Baseline Points - Points won from the backcourt.Net Points - Points won at the net.Errors - Total of unforced errors.Service Ace - Total Aces served.1st Serve % - Percentage of good first serves.Double Fault - Number of double faults.Difficulty LevelsStudy the following chart, so that you will select a difficulty level that is appropriate for you.Easy Normal HardBall Speed Slow Slow FastRacquet Contact Area Large Large StandardOpponent Power Weak Strong StrongPlayer's Body Can Obscure Ball No No YesPlayer Speed Slow Slow Fast* Note that the ball won't hit the player character's body.[CR]Mario's Tennis School (How to Play)[CR]ServiceWhen serving, check your opponents location on the court. use this to select the placement and depth of your serve. For the easiest serve, use the B Button without the Left Control Pad.Return of ServeWatch where the opponent stands during service, and try to effectively place a solid return of serve. If an opponent rushes the net just after serving, make sure that you use your lob.Groundstrokes, Volleys and SmashesTiming is very important on these shots. If you press the Left Control Pad too early, your player character will move and you may miss the shot. The placement of your shots can be affected by the timing of your swing of the racket. If you swing early or late it can change where your shot goes. For example, if you press the Left Control Pad and swing early while trying to hit a ball to the left, the ball will fly more sharply to the left. Being able to correctly time the swing of your racquet can directly affect your success on the court.Doubles PositioningWhen playing Doubles, do not stand directly behind or in front of your partner. In Doubles, maximum court coverage requires you and your partner to cover the sidelines effectively.[CR]Mario's Tennis School - THE RULES OF TENNIS[CR]PointsThe basic unit of scoring is the point. Points start from 0 (Love) and the first point scored is called 15. The second point is called 30. The third point is called 40. And the fourth point won wins the game. If the game reaches 40-40, it is called Deuce. The next point won gives that player the Advantage. If that players wins the next point, they win the game. If they lose the point, the score returns to Deuce, and play continues until one side with the Advantage wins a point.GamesA game is normally the first to win four points. Unless the match goes to Deuce. The first player to win six games wins a "Set" though the winner must beat the opponent by at least two games. If each side wins six games, there is a special game played called a Tie Break to determine who wins the set.Tie BreakAs mentioned, a Tie Break is played when the score is 6-6. In the Tie Break, the first person to win seven points, and win by two points, takes the set. The score for the set is recorded as 7-6.SetsReal matches are normally the best-of-three sets or the best-of-five sets. In Mario's Tennis, there is no best-of-five set match. So that matches can be quickly played, you have a choice between a one-set match and a best-of-three set match.Tennis Terms Used in the GameOut - If your shot lands outside the court, you lose that point. A sign appears telling you when a shot is out.Net - If your shot hits the net, and lands on your side of the net, you lose the point. A sign indicates when your shot hits the net and lands on your side.Fault - If your serve does not land in the service area, you "fault". If you fault twice in a row, it is called a "double fault," and you lose the point. During the game "Fault" and "Double Fault" will be indicated. The service area is the square that is near the net, and in front of where you opponent is standing prior to serve.Let - If your serve hits the net and falls in the service area, it is called a "Let". And you get to serve over again. "Let" will be displayed on-screen when this happens. If your serve hits the net but falls outside the service area, it is a fault.Serve - The server stands behind the baseline outside the court, tosses the ball and then hits it into the service are on the other side of the court. The service area is the square in the frontcourt ahead of your opponent. A serve must bounce before it is returned. Service lasts for one game, and it alternates between players.Groundstrokes - Hit the ball back to your opponent after it has bounced once.Overhead Smash - Hit the ball as it flies overhead. The Overhead Smash is a very fast, powerful shot.Volley - While close to the net, hit the ball before it bounces.Lob - Hit the ball over the head of an opponent who is at the net."Try to use the shots and information detailed above to your full advantage. Learning the terminology and rules will get you into the great game of tennis. Now it's time to hit the court!" - Mario</plot>

				<title_clean>Panic Bomber</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Panic Bomber, or Tobidase! Panibon, is a falling blocks puzzle game for various systems. It features characters and concepts from the Bomberman franchise; the falling pieces are mostly Bomberman heads and bombs.The goal is to line up same-colored Bomberman heads in lines of three or more horizontally, vertically or diagonally to remove them. Getting hit by multiple bombs, each of which projects an explosion in all four cardinal directions similar to their appearances in Bomberman, will also remove the heads. As the player drops and removes the Bomberman heads, the level of the stage increases and so too does the speed of the falling blocks.The game was originally released in 1994 for the PC Engine CD-ROM: a system that Panic Bomber developers Hudson co-created with NEC. It was later ported to the Neo Geo, the Super Famicom (as "Super Bomberman: Panic Bomber W", where the W stands for World), the Virtual Boy (where it saw its only North American release) and, eventually, the PlayStation Portable. A version of the game also appears in Bomberman Land 2 for the GameCube and PS2. The PC Engine CD-ROM version was added to the Japanese Wii's Virtual Console in 2008.</plot>

				<title_clean>Red Alarm</title_clean>
				<plot>Story  70 years into the future, a devastating world war has destroyed most of humanity. An advanced tactical system  called K.O.S (Killer Operating System) finally brought an end to the war. The people rejoiced as the system eliminated the enemy and peace  was restored. With a new government in place, the order was placed to  destroy all weapons so as to protect the world from any future threat.  KAOS, as it was later called, was also targeted for elimination.Unknown to the people, KAOS had a plan of its own. It  had become self aware, and had one goal ... to  survive. Unleashing its weapons on the undefended world, true chaos  erupted.  It's up to you, in the last remaining fighter, to take  to the sky and end its destructive reign. Gameplay Players pilot a Tech-Wing Fighter which has the capability to move in all directions.  Unlike its closest cousin Star Fox, in Red Alarm you can come to a full stop, turn your ship completely around, as well as fly in reverse.  However, your freedom is still limited to the corridor-based level structure, and your remaining fuel (which acts like a time limit).  The game uses both directional pads on the Virtual Boy's controller, one for controlling direction and pitch and the other for forward, reverse, and strafing left and right.  The ship's speed is controlled with A and B, allowing the player to cycle through various speeds or stop and go in reverse. Bosses often take place in large rooms, requiring you to pilot within the confined 3d space, while levels consist of corridors with the odd t-junction.  The controls do take some getting used to, as the game makes use of every button on the Virtual Boy controller, however they offer a great degree of control over the player's ship. Presentation Red Alarm is one of the more striking Virtual Boy games released, because of its excellent sense of three-dimensional depth and polygonal graphics.  However, all of the objects and environment are made up of only wire-frames, meaning it can be difficult for some gamers to avoid obstacles such as walls (particularly when up close).  That said, the game makes excellent use of the wire frame lines: a mid-boss in the first level is a mechanical face blocking your path which changes expressions; and even small details like tiny stick-figure people can be seen running around in the hangar bay.    The overall effect is one of looking into a piloting visor typical of many '80s sci-fi movies.  A nice feature is the optional replay after completing a stage, where players are free to adjust the camera angle.  The game also appears to run at a slightly better frame rate than   Star Fox on the  SNES.     Secrets The game contains a number of hidden secrets which appear when you shoot certain areas of the environment.  For example, you can find a 3d line drawing of the Virtual Boy, a woman wearing a bikini, and a tiny house with two people (stick figures) inside.</plot>

				<title_clean>Space Invaders - Virtual Collection</title_clean>
				<plot>Space Invaders Virtual Collection (released only in Japan) includes the original Space Invaders and Space Invaders Part II.  The game features 2D modes of each game, as well as a 3D mode where the playing field is tilted 45 degrees.  The game also includes a Challenge Mode that features Score Attack and Time Attack modes that can only be played in 3D.    Time Attack has the player complete a stage from Space Invaders in the quickest time possible, while Score Attack challenges players to get the highest score in a single stage from Space Invaders Part II.   The original Space Invaders retains the sound effects of the original 1978 release, and adds nothing new except for the slight perspective change and 3D view.  Space Invaders Part II also remains very similar to the original 1980 release except for an added background during Stage 1.  Space Invaders Virtual Collection remains as one of the rarest commercially released games, and is by far the rarest  Virtual Boy game.  Although it 's highly sought after by collectors, the Virtual Boy's 3D capabilities don't add much value to the gameplay and Taito neglected to include features to make the Virtual Boy release stand out from the many other Space Invader ports.</plot>

				<title_clean>Space Pinball</title_clean>
				<plot>Normally you would think that prototypes of released games are not even half as interesting as any unreleased stuff, and I'd say you're right, but in some cases those hardly resemble the final product. You can say the latter about this early version of what would later be released as "Galactic Pinball". What people got to play at Shoshinkai 1994 and CES 1995, where the Virtual Boy was first unveiled to the japanese and later the american people, looks (and feels) very different than the final released product, although, as you might think, many things were changed for good.[CR]When you start up the game, you see an early version of the adjustment screen, after which the game jumps directly to the title. No Precaution or Automatic Pause yet, but that wouldn't have made much sense anyway in an early exhibition software, would it? While the title screen looks a bit different with the different game logo, the following stage select screen has barely been changed for "Galactic Pinball", there are also five options which can be selected by rotating them. Instead of 4 tables and the highscores there are 5 tables in this prototype, though, and here at latest, it is becoming very interesting.[CR]None of the 5 available tables can be found in the final version of the game like they are in the prototype, but some still remind of "Galactic Pinball" more or less.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Panic Bomber, or Tobidase! Panibon, is a falling blocks puzzle game for various systems. It features characters and concepts from the Bomberman franchise; the falling pieces are mostly Bomberman heads and bombs.The goal is to line up same-colored Bomberman heads in lines of three or more horizontally, vertically or diagonally to remove them. Getting hit by multiple bombs, each of which projects an explosion in all four cardinal directions similar to their appearances in Bomberman, will also remove the heads. As the player drops and removes the Bomberman heads, the level of the stage increases and so too does the speed of the falling blocks.The game was originally released in 1994 for the PC Engine CD-ROM: a system that Panic Bomber developers Hudson co-created with NEC. It was later ported to the Neo Geo, the Super Famicom (as "Super Bomberman: Panic Bomber W", where the W stands for World), the Virtual Boy (where it saw its only North American release) and, eventually, the PlayStation Portable. A version of the game also appears in Bomberman Land 2 for the GameCube and PS2. The PC Engine CD-ROM version was added to the Japanese Wii's Virtual Console in 2008.</plot>

				<title_clean>Virtual Boy Wario Land</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Virtual Boy Wario Land in all its 2 color glory.  Virtual Boy Wario Land (known as Virtual Boy Wario Land: Secret Treasure of the Awazon in Japan) was released on November 27, 1995 in North America and December 1, 1995 in Japan. The game was one of fourteen          Virtual Boy games released in North America. The game was published by          Nintendo and developed by          Nintendo R&amp;D1. The game is most similar to         the first Wario Land game on the Nintendo Gameboy (and the engine for Virtual Boy Wario Land is actually a modified Wario Land engine). The game stars          Wario in a new quest to collect various riches and artifacts that have been stolen from him. Wario follows the thieves in to a labyrinth, where he finds himself trapped. The game is generally regarded as one of the best in the Virtual Boy library.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Solving a puzzle by throwing objects in to the background.  The gameplay of Virtual Boy Wario Land borrows heavily from Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3. It is a traditional platformer not to dissimilar to the        Super Mario Bros. games, with coins, breakable bricks, question blocks, and power-ups. The major element that differentiates it from a typical Mario is the game's greater focus on puzzle solving; Wario does not immediately defeat enemies he attacks, but instead stuns them. Stunned enemies and other objects can be picked up and thrown, and other moves in Wario's repertoire are similarly puzzle-focused, with a butt-stomp for destroying bricks below Wario, and a shoulder charge for breaking through walls. Much like Mario, if Wario takes damage, he will revert to a vulnerable "Small Wario" form. Collecting Garlic will bring Small Wario back to normal, and collecting Garlic while normal Wario will upgrade Wario's hat from a traditional       pith helmet to a viking helmet, making his shoulder charge considerably more powerful. Other hats for Wario to wear include an Eagle Helmet that allows Wario to fly, and a Dragon Helmet that breathes fire (within a limited range). In addition, the Eagle and Dragon Helmets can be combined to form a Super Dragon Helmet, which allows Wario to both fly and shoot powerful fireball projectiles simultaneously. Wario on a jump pad leading to a background layer.  Virtual Boy Wario Land uses the unique capabilities of the Virtual Boy to allow Wario to leap back and forth between background layers in the environment using special jump pads. Many levels require Wario to jump back and forth between foreground and background in order to progress or access secret areas. In addition, many of the game's boss encounters utilize foreground and background layers to attack the player. Virtual Boy Wario Land is notoriously short, containing only 10 levels and 4 boss encounters. However, each stage in the game contains at least one hidden treasure.  In addition,          Kazumi Totaka's famous          song  appears in the game. If the player waits on the word "End" at the end  of the game for one minute and fifteen seconds, then the song will play.</plot>

				<title_clean>Waterworld</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Waterworld is an action-adventure game that was originally released on the SNES in 1995. It was developed by Ocean and went on to be released on multiple platforms such as the Virtual Boy. Although it is considered as a licensed game, it's only loosely based on the movie. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens up with a series of stills from the movie with the movie's lore written on top. This is actually one of the only indications that the game has anything to do with the movie: The Sun, for millions of years the source of life, but for one planet the source of it's demise. The temperatures climbed, the vast fields of ice at its poles melted and the oceans rose. Centuries later, few people remained on this planet once called earth. The only remaining pockets of civilisation are floating islands of debris called Atolls.The player assumes the role of the Mariner, the drifter played by Kevin Costner in the movie, and fends off Smokers but that's about all the game has in common with the movie. Note: "it's" in the first line is a spelling mistake that the developers made. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game alternates between 3 different gameplay phases: some levels have the player piloting a boat, others have them doing some platforming and then there are the bonus stages: Boat levels: The player controls a sail boat and must fend off Smokers who are riding jet skis, planes and motor boats. They're attacking the Atolls and the player must destroy them with their missiles. They must also save drowning civilians. Platforming levels: Here the player takes control of the Mariner and must kill all the Smokers to move on to the next level. He starts off with a machete but can get other weapons, such as a gun, from the enemies he kills. The player always plays on the exact same level as they're always defending the same Atoll. Bonus levels: The player unlocks these after completing a boat level. It consists of the Mariner swimming underwater, trying to get bonus items before they run out of breath. If he runs out of breath while underwater, the player automatically loses all the items they had collected. These items earn points that can then be spent in the in-game shop to upgrade the ship.</plot>
